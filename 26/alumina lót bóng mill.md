Grinding the aluminum seems like just about the hardest and slowest way you could choose to produce it.

Generally, a bong downstem will have a joint size of 14MM, 18MM or even 10MM. The joint size must be a snug fit that keeps an air-tight seal while smoking. However, you should also consider the length of the bong downstem itself. Your downstem should be long enough to hit the water and produce bubbles upon inhalation.
