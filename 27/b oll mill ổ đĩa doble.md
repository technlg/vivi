Double ball nut designs produce preload in one of two ways: through tension between two single nuts, or through an offset in the lead of a single nut. The first method uses a spring or a spacer to create tension between two nuts that are mechanically coupled. In the second method, during machining of the ball nut raceways, an offset is created in the lead, approximately halfway down the length

Ball mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed, so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm. The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size - mills including a roller press are mostly single-chambered), allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media. Large balls are used at the inlet, to crush clinker
