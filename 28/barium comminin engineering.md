## Barium - New World Encyclopedia
Barium(chemical symbol Ba, atomic number56) is a soft, silvery chemical elementclassified as an alkaline earth metal. Given its reactivity with air, it is never found in its pure form in nature. In addition, its oxide reacts with waterand carbon dioxideand is not found as a mineral.

## Tungsten carbide
Tungsten carbide (chemical formula: WC) is a chemical compound (specifically, a carbide) containing equal parts of tungsten and carbon atoms. In its most basic form, tungsten carbide is a fine gray powder, but it can be pressed and formed into shapes through a process called sintering for use in industrial machinery, cutting tools, abrasives, armor-piercing shells and jewellery.

Barium in sediments is found largely in the form of barium sulfate (barite). Coarse silt sediment in a turbulent environment will often grind and cleave the barium sulfate from the sediment particles, leaving a buildup of dense barites.

Barium ferrite cards are based on a magnetic material similar to that used in magnetic signs and refrigerator magnets. A pattern of ones and zeros is arranged inside the card, and because the material is essentially a permanent magnet, it is very robust. Barium ferrite card readers can be configured for insertion or swipe type.
