## Bauxite mining: Nyinahin elders demand .
Research shows that bauxite mining at Nyinahin could last for over 150 to 300 years; and is estimated at $45 billion. This is significantly longer than at Atewa where, according to research, bauxite can only be mined for 30 years. But the estimated impact of the bauxite in Nyinahin, along with Awaso, and Tabi Offin, will not be as significantly damaging as mining in a watershed Atewa that

## Mining and Refining – Process
Bauxite is generally extracted by open cast mining, being almost always found near the surface, with processes that vary slightly depending on the location. Before mining can commence the land needs to be cleared of timber and vegetation. Alongside this process may be the collection of seeds and/or saplings, for inclusion in a seedbank, which will form the basis of post-mining revegetation of

Bauxite Mining. Scrapers and small excavators are used to remove the remaining overburden and expose the caprock. Depending on the depth of the caprock, it can be broken by blasting, or simply removed with scrapers and excavators. The bauxite is then mined using excavators or loaders to load the bauxite onto haul trucks and transported to the crusher. Several pits are usually mined

19.08.2020· By 2040, the capacity gap was expected to increase to 83 Mt, demonstrating a long-term need for investment in bauxite mining capacity. In the early 2020s, however, we expected a short-term global surplus of bauxite as the result of mine ramp-ups in Guinea (including our client's project), in Australia to a lesser degree and in China. In addition, with refinery closures in the US, CBG's

The Bauxite Hills Mine is a simple mining operation. Free-dig bauxite is mined by front-end loaders then trucked on dedicated haul roads to the port infrastructure. The bauxite is then screened to a maximum product size of 100mm and fed into the Barge Loading Facility (BLF) and into barges. Tugs tow the barges down the Skardon River and out to an anchorage point beyond the river mouth where
