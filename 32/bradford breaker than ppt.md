## MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) Working and Operation
Handling an MCB is electrically safer than a fuse. Quick restoration of supply is possible in case of a fuse as because fuses must be re-wirable or replaced for restoring the supply. Restoration is easily possible by just switching it ON. Let's look at the working of the miniature circuit breaker. Inside an MCB The working principle of MCB

## Fuses and Circuit Breakers - Danfoss
It is important to choose a fuse/Circuit Breaker with a low I2t [A2s]. This parameter is the energy required to clearing and is a measure of the damaging effect on the frequency converter. Fuses offer better protection of the frequency converter than Circuit Breakers as I2t is smaller for fuses.
