As of 2005 when Buffelsfontein mine went out of business, it became a burden on the remaining mines to keep the interconnected tunnels free of water. History [ edit ] A small pass above town, Hartebeesfontein Poort, was the scene of a Boer War skirmish on February 17, 1901.

## Buffelsfontein Gold Mine - Buffelsfontein
In August 1997 DRD bought the Hartebeestfontein Mine from the Anglovaal group and consolidated it with Buffelsfontein creating separate north and south divisions. DRD operated the mine until March 22, 2005 at which point they put it under provisional liquidation after continued losses and a March 9 seismic event which damaged a shaft.
