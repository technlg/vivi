· Therefore, the energy consumption for bead milling is highly related to a design parameter, i.e., installed power (kW), and the biomass treatment rate (kg/h). However, it should be noted that each equipment has its own optimal feed flow rate/biomass flow rate and DCW limitations since higher feed flow rate and DCW lead to a lower cell disruption efficiency. For example, a 3-fold .
