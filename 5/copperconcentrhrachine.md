· Copper (Cu) distribution in soil is influenced by climatic, geological and pedological factors. Apart from geological sources and industrial pollution, other anthropogenic sources, related to the agricultural activity, may increase copper levels in soils, especially in permanent crops such as olive groves and vineyards.

Copper Concentration Analysis The technique of analyzing the concentration of dissolved copper in an acid copper plating bath is identical to that for analyzing the copper in "peroxy-sulfuric" type etchants. The only real difference is the range of allowable concentrations and the methods used to reduce the copper level in an overdosed bath.

CUCRU : The biliary system is the major pathway of copper excretion. Biliary excretion of copper requires an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent transporter protein. Mutations in the gene for the transporter protein cause hepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson disease). Ceruloplasmin, the primary copper-carrying protein in the blood, is also reduced in Wilson disease.

Based on this review, the proposed guidelines for copper in drinking water are a maximum acceptable concentration of 2 mg/L (2000 µg/L) and an aesthetic objective of 1 mg/L (1000 µg/L).

## Copper in plants and soil
Ideally, for healthy and productive soil, the concentration of copper should be 2‑50 mg/kg. it would be a good idea to investigate the reasons behind high levels if a copper concentration of greater than 6000 mg/kg is detected in your soil.

## Iodometric Determination of Cu in Brass - Chemistry LibreTexts
Reactions Involved in Iodometric Processes. Iodometric methods depend on the following equilibrium: [I_2 + I^- rightleftharpoons I_3^-] Since the solubility of I 2 in water is quite low, the formation of the tri-iodide ion, I 3-, allows us to obtain useful concentrations of I 2 in aqueous solutions. The equilibrium constant for this reaction is approximately 700.

## Copper extraction
· Copper Mining: The commonest ore used in the extraction of copper is Chalcopyrite (CuFeS 2) also known as Copper Pyrites and other such sulphides. The percentage of copper in the actual ore is too low for direct extraction of copper to be viable. The concentration of ore is required and it is done by the Froth Flotation method.
